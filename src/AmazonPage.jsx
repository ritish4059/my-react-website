        Amazon is one of the most successful and largest e-commerce platforms globally. Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, 
        Amazon started as an online bookstore but quickly expanded into selling a wide variety of products, including electronics, 
        clothing, and more. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What sets Amazon apart is its customer-centric approach, fast delivery services like Amazon Prime, and innovations like 
        Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a leader in cloud computing. Over the years, Amazon has also introduced smart devices 
        like the Amazon Echo, Kindle, and Fire TV.
      </p>
      <p>
        With constant innovation and expansion into new markets, Amazon remains one of the most valuable companies in the world.
